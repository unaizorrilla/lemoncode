# Bundling 03 - Vite Mandatory  + Optional

Implement a simple application that:

- It should be set up with TypeScript and allow type errors to be detected in the terminal, if any.

- You should be able to see the bundle size.

- It should have the start script to launch the development server and preview to serve the production build.

- It should support environment variables. You can use a string displayed with console.log that has one value in development (when running locally with npm start) and another value when building and viewing with npm run preview.

- Create an H1 element with text using the DOM API, and style that H1 using CSS Modules.

- Add to the Vite starter project the necessary configuration so that when building, it also generates the compressed files (GZIP and BROTLI). Therefore, after running the build, the files dist/index.js.gz and dist/index.js.br should exist.
