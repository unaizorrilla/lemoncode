# Bundling 03 - WebPack Mandatory

Implement a simple application that:

- Has bundling set up with Webpack.

- Displays a logo (for example, the Lemoncode logo or any other you prefer).

- Displays the text “hello world” styled with SASS.

# Setup

Open the code using the **Reopen in Container** feature from *Dev Containers extension* in **VS Code**

# Install dependencies

To install dependencies execute the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

# Run

To run the Webpack mandatory exercise please follow the command:

```bash
npm run start
```

And open the url from the output, something like

```bash

<i> [webpack-dev-server] Loopback: http://localhost:8080/, http://[::1]:8080/
<i> [webpack-dev-server] On Your Network (IPv4): http://172.17.0.2:8080/
